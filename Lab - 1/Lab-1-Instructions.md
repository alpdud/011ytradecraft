# Lab 1

## Uptime 

The Uptime app is for viewing result data from lightweight monitors running through Heartbeat and configured with a traditional heartbeat.yml file. This is for TCP, HTTP or ICMP monitors that you have configured and run from your own infrastructure with Heartbeat natively.

The lab walks you through installing hearbeat on the lab VM and then configuring it to provide additional insights.

1. Navigate to Integrations. 
2. Search for Uptime

1. Follow the steps prompted in the page, execute them in the lab machine and view the Uptime App.

1. We will now enhance the file to enrich the data. Update the hearbeat.yml file to include the following.
    ```yaml
        
    heartbeat.monitors:
    - type: http
  id: elastic-homepage
  name: Elastic.co Homepage
  hosts: ["https://elastic.co"]
  schedule: '@every 10m

2. Lets now create some custom visualizations too.

3. Create a visualization thats displays External HTTP Roundtrip latency per domain. It should look something like below. Ofcourse, would change for every individual.

## Synthetics.

> Due to the constraints of the Lab environment, we will try installing and running the synthetics recorder on your machine. If your organization IT policies do not allow installation of the synthetics, please use the below script.

1. Use the playwright script recorded for a website.
   ```javascript
      step('Go to https://news.ycombinator.com/', async () => {
        await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com/', {
            timeout: 0,
            waitUntil: 'load'
        });
      });
      step('Go to https://news.ycombinator.com/newest', async () => {
        await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com/newest', {
            timeout: 0,
            waitUntil: 'load'
        });
      });
      step('Go to https://news.ycombinator.com/front', async () => {
        await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com/front', {
            timeout: 0,
            waitUntil: 'load'
        });
      });
      step('Go to https://news.ycombinator.com/ask', async () => {
        await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com/ask', {
            timeout: 0,
            waitUntil: 'load'
        });
      });
    ```
2. Navigate to Monitor at Observability --> Synthetics. Enter the details as per the screenshot below
   ![Alt text](../assets/image-11.png)
   You could choose any other url, but the script would have to change accordingly. 
3. Create a multi step monitor. In the script editor, copy paste the snippet from step 1 above.
